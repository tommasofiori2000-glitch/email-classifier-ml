# Email Classifier – Machine Learning Project

This project implements a Python-based email classification system developed
as part of a Machine Learning course.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to preprocess and classify corporate emails
using supervised machine learning techniques. The workflow includes text
cleaning, sentence segmentation, keyword extraction, email summarization, and
classification based on semantic coherence.

## Methods
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Sentence segmentation and word frequency analysis
- Keyword extraction and email summarization
- Supervised classification strategies
- Comparison of alternative classification approaches

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Basic NLP techniques

## Notes
This project was developed for educational purposes and focuses on the design
of a clear and modular machine learning pipeline.
